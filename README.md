# MusicGenreClassifier
This project uses the GTZAN Genre Collection (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlthome/gtzan-genre-collection) to train and compare a few different machine learning classification models and their ability to identify the genre of an audio file of a song. The dataset consists of 100 sample tracks from each of 10 genres for a total of 1000 30 second clips. I use the librosa python library to load and extract features from the audio files and scikit-learn/scipy to train models.
